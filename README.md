# Text_Similarity
Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human language, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. Text Similarity is one of the essential techniques of NLP which is being used to find the closeness between two chunks of text by surface or meaning. Computers require data to be converted into a numeric format to perform any machine learning task. On the surface is only word level similarity (lexical), these two phrases appear very similar as 3 of the 4 unique words are an exact overlap. This approach does not take into account the actual meaning behind words or the entire phrase in context. So, semantic similarity can be considered to focus on phrase/paragraph levels (or lexical chain level) where a piece of text is broken into a relevant group of related words prior to computing similarity. This notebook first presents an introduction to data processing for NLP and then text similarity for both surface and meaning level are applied. The approaches are **Jaccard** similarity, **Cosine** similarity, **Inverse Document Frequency**, **Glove pre-trained method** and **Word Mover Distance**.

Python functions and data files to run this notebook are in my [Github](https://github.com/MehdiRezvandehy/Text_Similarity.git) page.
